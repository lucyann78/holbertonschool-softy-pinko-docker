This project explores the fundamentals of Docker, a platform used to containerize applications into lightweight, portable environments. By packaging software and all its dependencies into isolated containers, Docker ensures consistent behavior across different systems and eliminates common issues related to configuration and deployment. The project demonstrates how to build and run Docker containers locally, highlighting how they simplify application distribution and scaling. It also serves as a foundation for understanding container orchestration tools like Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
